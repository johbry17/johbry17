A versatile generalist with expertise in Python and a broad analytical toolkit, I bring a passion for solving complex problems and meticulous attention to detail to every project. My diverse experiences—spanning two advanced degrees, extensive global travel, and a decade in hospitality—have sharpened my adaptability, communication skills, and ability to build rapport with people from all walks of life. I thrive on learning, synthesizing knowledge across disciplines, and delivering clear, impactful insights.

“I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.” - E.B. White

I'm a data analyst and visualization geek with a generalist's brain, a traveler's soul, and a bartender’s heart. I love puzzles—especially the kind hidden inside messy datasets. With Python in one hand and Plotly in the other, I bring structure to chaos and tell stories with data that people actually want to read.

When I'm not doing that, I'm probably devouring books, tending a garden, chasing sunlight across continents, or wandering through a new city with curiosity as my compass.

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL, C, JavaScript
- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, D3.js, Tableau
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, mongoDB
- **Web Development**: Flask, Django, Dash, HTML5, CSS/Sass, Beautiful Soup
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Keras, TensorFlow
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, RStudio, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git, GitHub

By day, I wrangle data. By night (and weekends), I’m an explorer—of books, trails, cities, and ideas. I'm a data analyst and visualization specialist who thrives on learning, solving, and making the complex clear. My path has taken me through two Master’s degrees, five continents, countless datasets, and a surprising number of cocktail shakers. Each step sharpened my people skills, problem-solving mindset, and thirst for understanding.

I’m happiest where curiosity meets impact—and where data can help us understand and improve the world we live in.
