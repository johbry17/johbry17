I am a data analyst and visualization specialist driven by curiosity, creativity, and a dedication to lifelong learning. A versatile generalist with expertise in Python and a broad analytical toolkit, I bring a passion for solving complex problems and meticulous attention to detail to every project. My diverse experiences—spanning two advanced degrees, extensive global travel, and a decade in hospitality—have sharpened my adaptability, communication skills, and ability to build rapport with people from all walks of life. I thrive on learning, synthesizing knowledge across disciplines, and delivering clear, impactful insights.

<!-- I'm a data analyst and visualization geek with a generalist's brain, a traveler's soul, and a bartender’s heart. I love puzzles—especially the kind hidden inside messy datasets. With Python in one hand and Plotly in the other, I bring structure to chaos and tell stories with data that people actually want to read.

When I'm not doing that, I'm probably devouring books, tending a garden, chasing sunlight across continents, or wandering through a new city with curiosity as my compass. -->

I'm a data analyst and visualization nerd with a generalist's curiosity, a traveler's wonder, and a bartender’s rapport. 

I approach data like a translator, blending analytical rigor with the emotional clarity of storytelling to bridge insight and audience, helping it click with anyone reading. My projects are hands-on, thoughtful, and well-documented—designed not just to solve problems, but to communicate them clearly. I care as much about the *why* as the *how*. 

Lately, I’ve turned that same lens toward machine learning, working to make predictive models as understandable as they are powerful.

Beyond the pixels, I read widely, nurture a thriving garden, and chase sunshine across continents. You’ll often find me happily lost in mountain switchbacks, shoreline strolls, or neighborhoods old and new.

By day, I wrangle data. By night (and weekends), I’m an explorer—of books, trails, cities, and ideas. I'm a data analyst and visualization specialist who thrives on learning, solving, and making the complex clear. My path has taken me through two Master’s degrees, five continents, countless datasets, and a surprising number of cocktail shakers. Each step sharpened my people skills, problem-solving mindset, and thirst for understanding.

I’m happiest where curiosity meets impact—and where data can help us understand and improve the world we live in.
