I am a data analyst and visualization specialist driven by curiosity, creativity, and a dedication to lifelong learning. A versatile generalist with expertise in Python and a broad analytical toolkit, I bring a passion for solving complex problems and meticulous attention to detail to every project. My diverse experiences‚Äîspanning two advanced degrees, extensive global travel, and a decade in hospitality‚Äîhave sharpened my adaptability, communication skills, and ability to build rapport with people from all walks of life. I thrive on learning, synthesizing knowledge across disciplines, and delivering clear, impactful insights.

‚ÄúI arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve (or save) the world and a desire to enjoy (or savor) the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.‚Äù - E.B. White
